    <p>Turkmenistan, is a neutral and independent country in Central Asia. It has a long history, culture,
    traditions and attractions.</p>
    <h2>Excerpts from Lonely Planet</h2>
    <q>…it's an ancient land of great spirituality, tradition and natural beauty.</q><br>
    <blockquote>“The ancient cities of Merv and Konye-Urgench inspire visions of caravans plodding along the ancient Silk Road, 
    while the haunting beauty of the Karakum desert and other quirky natural phenomena are equally mesmerising. The full Turkmen experience is ultimately about mingling 
    with the warm and fascinating people themselves, whose 
    hospitality is the stuff of legend.”</blockquote>
