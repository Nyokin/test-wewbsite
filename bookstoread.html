    <p>Turkmenistan, is a neutral and independent country in Central Asia. It has a long history, culture,
    traditions and attractions.</p>
    <h2>Excerpts from Lonely Planet</h2>
    <q>…it's an ancient land of great spirituality, tradition and natural beauty.</q><br>
    <blockquote>“The ancient cities of Merv and Konye-Urgench inspire visions of caravans plodding along the ancient Silk Road, 
    while the haunting beauty of the Karakum desert and other quirky natural phenomena are equally mesmerising. The full Turkmen experience is ultimately about mingling 
    with the warm and fascinating people themselves, whose 
    hospitality is the stuff of legend.”</blockquote>

       <h2>History of Central Asia</h2>
	   <h5>Christoph Baumer, 2018</h5>
  	<p>This set includes all four volumes of the critically acclaimed History of Central Asia series. The epic plains and arid 
	deserts of Central Asia have witnessed some of the greatest migrations, as well as many of the most transformative developments,
	in the history of civilization. Christoph Baumer's ambitious four-volume treatment of the region charts the 3000-year drama 
	of Scythians and Sarmatians; Soviets and transcontinental Silk Roads; trade routes and the transmission of ideas across the steppes; and the breathless and brutal conquests of Alexander the Great and Chinghiz Khan. Masterfully interweaving the stories of individuals and peoples, the author's engaging prose is richly augmented throughout by colour photographs taken on his own travels. 
   This set includes The Age of the Steppe Warriors (Volume 1), The Age of the Silk Roads (Volume 2), 
    The Age of Islam and the Mongols (Volume 3) and The Age of Decline and Revival (Volume 4) </p>

       <h2>The Great Game: The Struggle for Empire in Central Asia</h2>
	   <h5>Peter Hopkirk, 1994</h5>
    <p>Peter Hopkirk’s spellbinding account of the great imperial struggle for supremacy in Central Asoa has been hailed as 
	essential reading with that era’s legacy playing itself out today. The Great Game between Victorian Britain and Tsarist Russia
	was fought across desolate terrain from the Caucasus to China, over the lonely passes of the Parmirs and Karakorams, in the 
	blazing Kerman and Helmund deserts, and through the caravan towns of the old Silk Road—both powers scrambling to control access
	to the riches of India and the East. When play first began, the frontiers of Russia and British India lay 2000 miles apart;
	by the end, this distance had shrunk to twenty miles at some points. Now, in the vacuum left by the disintegration of the
	Soviet Union, there is once again talk of Russian soldiers "dipping their toes in the Indian Ocean."

	<p>The Washington Post has said that "every story Peter Hopkirk touches is totally engrossing." In this gripping narrative he 
	recounts a breathtaking tale of espionage and treachery through the actual experiences of its colorful characters.
	Based on meticulous scholarship and on-the-spot research, this is the history at the core of today’s geopolitics.</p></p>

       <h2>Empires of the Silk Road: a history of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the present </h2>
	   <h5>Christopher I. Beckwith</h5>
    <p>The first complete history of Central Eurasia from ancient times to the present day, Empires of the Silk Road represents a 
	fundamental rethinking of the origins, history, and significance of this major world region. Christopher Beckwith describes the 
	rise and fall of the great Central Eurasian empires, including those of the Scythians, Attila the Hun, the Turks and Tibetans,
	and Genghis Khan and the Mongols. In addition, he explains why the heartland of Central Eurasia led the world economically, 
	scientifically, and artistically for many centuries despite invasions by Persians, Greeks, Arabs, Chinese, and others. 
	In retelling the story of the Old World from the perspective of Central Eurasia, Beckwith provides a new understanding of the 
	internal and external dynamics of the Central Eurasian states and shows how their people repeatedly revolutionized Eurasian
	civilization.</p>
	<p>Beckwith recounts the Indo-Europeans' migration out of Central Eurasia, their mixture with local peoples, and the resulting 
	development of the Graeco-Roman, Persian, Indian, and Chinese civilizations; he details the basis for the thriving economy of 
	premodern Central Eurasia, the economy's disintegration following the region's partition by the Chinese and Russians in the
	eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and the damaging of Central Eurasian culture by Modernism; and he discusses 
	the significance for world history of the partial reemergence of Central Eurasian nations after the collapse of the 
	Soviet Union.</p>
	<p>Empires of the Silk Road places Central Eurasia within a world historical framework and demonstrates why the region is 
	central to understanding the history of civilization.</p>
